# Fintech Case Study: Synthetix

## **Overview** ##

[Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) is a decentralised, Ethereum-based protocol that enables the issuance of synthetic assets.

Analogous to derivatives in legacy finance, synthetic assets are financial instruments in the form of ERC-20 smart contracts known as “Synths”. Users are able to mint, hold, and trade a wide range of synthetic derivatives – including crypto, commodities, FIAT currencies, and even stock. 

Synths can be traded with infinite liqiduity and zero slippage by leveraging the Synthetix protocol’s unique pooled collateral model. Synthetix’s native token, the Synthetix Network Token (SNX), is used to provide collateral against Synths that are issued. 

### *How does it work?* ###
Synths copy the price of the asset in the “real world” and brings it onto the Ethereum blockchain giving that Synth all the properties of an ERC20 token. 

Synths that can be traded on the platform's decentralised exchange include a diverse range of asset types and classes spanning; 
- Cryptocurrencies 
- Forex 
- Equities; and 
- Commodities.

Trades between Synths generate a small fee that is distributed to synthetic token (SNX) collateral providers.

### *Origin* ###
Synthetix is a Sydney-based DeFi project with over **$1.7B USD** worth of value locked in.  

Synthetix began as a stable-coin project named Havven and was founded by Kain Warwick, the current Synthetix CEO. Synthetix rebranded and expanded its scope prior to launching on mainnet in February 2019. The focus shifted away from a single stable-coin to the then emerging multi-currency concept attached to synthetic assets and the creation of the SNX token. 

### *Financing* ###
Synthetix has raised a total of $46M in funding over 5 rounds with the latest occuring in [February 2021](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/havven/company_financials) with backing from Coinbase Ventures and Paradigm.

## **Business Activities:** ##

Synthetic assets provide users with exposure to an asset without holding the underlying resource. This has a range of advantages including reducing friction when switching between different asset classes and expanding the accessibility of asset markets.

Synthetix provides a significant change to the traditional financial market capabilties beyond this however. Most notably is the ability for anyone to convert Synths without the need for a counterparty. 

Any Synth can be traded for any other Synth on the Synthetix Exchange, and the functionality it has provides for an almost infinite level of liquidity.  


As synths are collateralized through the Synthetix token SNX, they are able to drive value and liquidity to the underlying assets while also offering an increased level of accessibility to traditional financial assets and offer new trading strategies.

Another innovation the Synthetix network offers is peer-to-contract (P2C) trading, where the trades themselves are executed quickly and easily – all without any order book. A distributed pool of token holders is responsible for providing this collateral on the platform, as well as maintaining the stability of the entire exchange. 

Synths can be in any form and are designated with a prefix of “s” – FIAT synths look like sEUR, sUSD, and so on. 

Users do not need to trade in the same Synth type that was originally coined. As long as the Synth that is used for payment has the same market value, it will be accepted by the system.

## **Landscape** ##
 
Within the derivatives markets area of the DeFi world Synthetix is uniquely positioned. There are few projects that are specialising within the synthetic asset space.

## **Results** ##

As mentioned above Synthetix currently has $1.9B worth of value locked in the platform. This makes Synthetix the 11th largest De-Fi project in the space as at 20 May 2020 via [DeFi-Pulse](https://defipulse.com/). 

The maximum supply of SNX is 212,424,133 tokens. Currently there are 153,917,884 SNX in circulation.

Through their Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Synthetix sold over 60 million tokens, raising $30 million USD. 

Out of the 100,000,000 tokens sold in the ICO, 20% was distributed to the team and advisors, 3% was allocated to bounties and marketing incentives, 5% went to partnerships, and 12% was given to the Synthetix Foundation to fund further development.

## **Recommendations** ##

There has been some concerns with the centralised nature of the platform. This has been raised due to the underlying technology requirements for the synthetic assets which do not allow for full decentralisation. The recommendation would be to provide assurance to investors and community members of the safety, transparency and security of investments.
